# Windows desktop computer use

Use `node_repl` with the host-enabled desktop client for all computer interaction. This API provides screenshots and input only. It does not expose accessibility trees, window enumeration, application scripting, or browser internals.

Create one client and take a screenshot before acting:

```js
const { create_client } = await import("@oai/sky/client");
const desktop = await create_client({ target: "windows", api: "desktop" });
const [screenshot] = await desktop.get_screenshot();
await nodeRepl.emitImage(screenshot.data_url);
```

Read `api.md` for the complete supported API. Use only that API for desktop interaction. Reuse `desktop` across calls and close it when finished.

Coordinates are pixels relative to the latest screenshot, which combines the visible monitors. Take a new screenshot after the display layout changes. Input goes to the current focus. The cursor stays where you move it; use `move` for hover and `drag_handle` to hold the mouse button while inspecting a screenshot. End the drag when finished.

Emit screenshots with `nodeRepl.emitImage`. Inspect the visible result before continuing if the application is still updating. Files backing screenshots are removed when the client closes.

On a physical Escape stop, stop using computer tools and tell the user. If a session is closed or cleanup fails, stop and report the error; do not create another session to bypass it.
